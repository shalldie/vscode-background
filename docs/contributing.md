[English](./contributing.md) | [中文](./contributing.zh-CN.md)

Welcome! We are really excited that you are interested in contributing to `vscode-background`. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guide:

## Means of Contributing

Contributing doesn't necessarily mean you need to write code and open Pull Requests. There are many other ways you can help the project!

- Try the latest version and report bugs.
- Answer to other people's questions.
- Share your idea on the issues.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Checkout a topic branch from a base branch, e.g. `master`, and merge back against that branch.

- If adding a new feature:

  - Open a `Feature Request` issue first, and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing bug:

  - If you are resolving a special issue, add (fix #xxxx[,#xxxx]) (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for better readability.
  - e.g. `fix: update entities encoding/decoding (fix #2233)`

- Make sure to follow the code style of the project.
